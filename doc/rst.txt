What are these .rst files? They are reStructuredText (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), a document format that is plaintext and human-interpretable. It is similar to Markdown (used by many blogging systems), but with better Python support.

You can process these files with Docutils, but this is very heavyweight typesetting software, and you probably don't care about most of its features. A couple of alternatives are suggested:

rst2html5
https://bitbucket.org/andre_felipe_dias/rst2html5

Obtain via:
  pip install rst2html5

rst2pdf
http://rst2pdf.ralsina.me/stories/index.html might be slow or unreachable. Presumably, connectivity in Montenegro can be a little unreliable. There's also https://github.com/rst2pdf/rst2pdf or https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rst2pdf. It uses ReportLab, a professionally produced open source PDF library that isn't too hard on your free disk space.

Obtain via:
  pip install rst2pdf
