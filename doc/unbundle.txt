Required to run the source code directly:

Python 2.7          http://www.python.org/
Python MegaWidgets  http://pmw.sourceforge.net/

To create a tidy zipfile with executable:

PyInstaller         http://www.pyinstaller.org/

Pip, the Python Package Installer, is your friend. He is included with 
the Python distribution, under the "Scripts" directory on Windows. On 
Linux systems, pip should already be on your command line, as Python is 
a standard system utility. You will need root permissions to use it, 
however.

Once Python is installed, use pip to obtain the other dependencies:

Python MegaWidgets:
pip install pmw

PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller


To create a tidy bundle, a script is provided that invokes PyInstaller 
and does a little post-processing to tidy up a bit and create the zipfile.

python devbin/bundle.py

The zipfile will appear in the bundles directory.

There is one further note. Pmw as installed is not compatible with the 
dependency detection that tools such as PyInstaller use. It comes with a 
utility for this purpose, however. You should not need to use it, unless 
a different version of Pmw, or the use of its color support, is desired. 
The one included is v1.3.3.

This is the command I used to bundle Pmw. The command for Linux or
similar should be analagous.

python \Python27\Lib\site-packages\Pmw\Pmw_1_3_3\bin\bundlepmw.py
-nocolor -noblt \Python27\Lib\site-packages\Pmw\Pmw_1_3_3\lib
